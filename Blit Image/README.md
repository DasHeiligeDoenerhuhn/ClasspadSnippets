# Blit Image
This folder contains a code snippet that loads an image into RAM and then just draws it to the screen without using the VRAM or LCD_Refresh.
This speeds up the screen refresh process significantly.
565.py just converts a 100x100 image into 565 color.
Make your own image, name it "image.png" or change the name in 565.py, run 565.py and then copy it into the root of your classpad. The output file should be renamed to "test.bin".
