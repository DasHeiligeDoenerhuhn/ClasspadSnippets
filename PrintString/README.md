# PrintString
This is a template for using the PrintStringCustomRefresh and PrintCharCustomRefresh functions, which can as the name suggests print a string to the lcd screen of the casio classpad 2 without using any VRAM. To use these functions in your own project, just copy debug_refresh.h and debug_refresh.s and include them in the source file you wanna use them in.
